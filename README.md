Drop these folders into: 3.3.5 Client\Interface\AddOns

Currently have Vanilla working and TBC partially working, ned to sort out some issues with quests of the same name


used the base AI Voiceover addon from MrThinger https://www.curseforge.com/members/mrthinger/projects

And used some data from Darkneo https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkneo/projects

Please let me know if there are any bugs, likely from quest chains of the same name or alliance vs horde issues
